    <h1>How is scrz different from Capistrano or Fabric?</h1>
    <p>
    Both Capistrano and Fabric require that the person performing the deployment
    has SSH access to the servers. Scrz uses a management server and developers
    only need access to that. Scrz then automatically distributes your
    application to the servers.

    <h1>How do I create a slug?</h1>
    <p>
    A slug is a SquashFS image. Use mksquashfs from the squashfs-tools
    package to create it.
    The image should contain your applications and all
    dependencies which are not provided by the host (such as gems or node
    packages).
    </p>
    <p>
    I highly recommend that you create a script which prepares
    your app, downloads dependencies, compiles binaries etc.
    Here is such script for a Ruby on Rails app. It assumes that the bundler
    gem is installed on the host.
    </p>
    <pre><code>bundle --deployment --without development test
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile</code></pre>
    <p>To run the application server off of this slug, use the entry point
    <code>bundle exec rails server</code>.
